# Through maze - path finding algorithms
Side project inspired by [Computerphile video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rop0W4QDOUI) and accompanying [source code by Mike Pound](https://github.com/mikepound/mazesolving). The original code was written in python so I though it'd be fun to reimplement it in Java. It is also a nice exercise for me to better understand path finding algorithms, especially famous Dijkstra and A star.

The program goes through a black and white maze, maps all vertices and based on them finds a path from top of the maze to the bottom, based on given algorithm.

The mazes are generated by [Daedalus](http://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth/daedalus.htm).

Currently only turn left algorithm and one version of Dijkstra algorithm are implemented, but I am looking forward to implement other algorithms in some spare time.
